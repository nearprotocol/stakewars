## UPDATE Nov 12th

* Just update the issue templates. We are now measuring severity internally since the templates were just confusing.
* The simplified submission process is: just follow the template, and we will add label.
* If we add the `help wanted` tag, you can fix it and receive tokens as part of the competition as well

## UPDATE Nov 22nd

## UPDATE Dec 13th

* We're restructuring the program to focus on finding bugs that are based on QA scenarios rather than security breaches and attacks.
