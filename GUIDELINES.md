# Stake Wars 2.0 Guidelines

## Format
This new phase of Stake Wars will test stake delegation to validators. The winners will be those validators who deploy reliable nodes and challenge the boundaries of Proof of Stake, by offering innovative delegation solutions that can attract the favor of Stake Wars participants. The larger the stake you will attract from real users, the bigger your success during the Stake Wars and beyond, when the MainNet will be running on your nodes.
NEAR Protocol will promote this initiative across all its channels, by progressively releasing Stake Wars to every user who owns a TestNet wallet. This will be a unique opportunity to attract NEAR adopters on your platform and grow your validator business.

This is not going to be easy: we will deploy hard forks constantly, we will test your team reactivity in case of network issues, we will run benchmarks at the network level, and we will measure the strenght of the participants as a whole.
However, Stake Wars is not about doing things right or wrong. It is mostly about learning how smart contract-based delegation works, and get ready to run NEAR together.

## Rules
There are no strict rules, rather guidelines and examples. Judges on NEAR side will rate your participation, and will update the [leaderboard](LEADERBOARD.md) every week with basic node information.

*If you are acting in good faith, you’re almost assuredly good. If you’re acting in bad faith, moderators will exclude you from the competition.*

Here are some examples and we will trust you to follow the spirit of the law:

### DO…
* Check out the QA scenarios and run them on your system.
* Read the documentation, and open GitHub issues if you find ways to improve it.
* Run your node like it's a production environment and you are staking with real funds.
* Run any kind of benchmark you think is valuable.
* Try staking in all sorts of ways
  * You will be rewarded for creativity, effort and magnitude of the submission
* Write reports on your experience and send them to us publicly.
* Complain about things that need fixing or cleanup!

### DON’T…
* Do anything illegal in order to hack our stuff.
* Hack other peoples’ computers or use attack vectors that are outside of our control
  * For example, if you add a keylogger to someone’s computer, that is showing a flaw in their Operational Security not a flaw in the system we’re building.
* Harass people in any way. This includes community members and team members.
* Be a jerk.


## Our Goals for this
We want...

* You to build things that solve your own problems as future validators on the network
* To put the last year or so of hard work in front of our community to try it out
* To find glaring flaws in our systems, designs and code
* To learn what your needs are as part of the validator community
