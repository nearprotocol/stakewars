# UPDATES

## UPDATE Dec 13th

* We're restructuring the program to focus on finding bugs that are based on QA scenarios rather than security breaches and attacks.
* You can find these in `scenarios.md` in this repo. [HERE](./scenarios.md)

## UPDATE Nov 22nd

* We're using Github to collect genesis for this week. Please don't submit your keys for genesis if you can't make the call. Put in a PR againts accounts.csv with your changes.

## UPDATE Nov 20th

* sudo is no longer needed if you're on Mac, or if you're on linux and can run docker without sudo.

## UPDATE Nov 12th

* Just update the issue templates. We are now measuring severity internally since the templates were just confusing.
* The simplified submission process is: just follow the template, and we will add label.
* If we add the `help wanted` tag, you can fix it and receive tokens as part of the competition as well
