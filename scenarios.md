# Stake Wars 2.0 Test Scenarios
Please note that Stake Wars is not rewarding anymore node-related test scenarios. Instead, we want you to test the functionalities of the delegation smart contracts, by performing the following actions:
- deposit and withdraw tokens
- lock and unlock tokens in the staking
- measure the rewards

These tests will accelerate the production deployment of the reference delegation contract, and will simplify the staking experience for our users.

# [OBSOLETE] Here are some test scenarios you can earn points for

## This list will expand over time

Some of these scenarios will require reaching out to request something from us. The best place to do that is Discord. We're going to set the wallet to start accounts at 100k NEAR starting next week. If you have specific things you need aside from that, please let us know for future tests.

### \* Time Series Challenge

Connect to the network, work for 10 sec, disconnect from the network, wait for 10 sec, repeat.

Do this for values: 1 sec, 10 sec, and 60 sec.

This can be probably emulated through some Linux tool that blocks network connections, just have a cron job that blocks network for X seconds, then unblocks it for X sec, repeat.
